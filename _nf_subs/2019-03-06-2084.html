  _field_3: "Dear Dr Sumaiya,\n\nMy name is Brianna Zamparelli and I am studying the
    SACE stage 2 subject Research Project in Adelaide, Australia.\nThis subject requires
    me to investigate a topic of my own choice. I have chosen dieting and anti-aging.
    My question is “To what extent do certain food prevent signs of aging?”\nFrom
    my preliminary research I have discovered that you have knowledge in this area
    and I would appreciate your assistance with my topic, particularly in the specific
    area of anti-inflammatories and the best options avaliable. \nIf possible I would
    like to interview you, and I suggest anytime in the next few weeks.\nIf this is
    not possible, I was wondering if you would respond to a few of my questions via
    email.\n\nThank you for your time and I look forward to future correspondence.\n\nKind
    regards Brianna Zamparelli"
