<p>A therapeutic Diet in itself can solve many of your problems. Dietary therapy prescribed by a registered dietitian is needed for all . I being a registered dietitian and doctor have been successfully helping patients achieve their optimum weight goals and help in several diseases.The best diet is one which is healthy and well balanced with foods from all the food groups, and one which is varied and that you can stick to . Being a registered Dietitian I strongly accommodate the patients own preferences without the patient feeling that they are on a diet not compromising the weight management goals.I will also prescribe medicines that will speed up the time to achieve your weight management goals and help heal many of your lifestyle diseases.
