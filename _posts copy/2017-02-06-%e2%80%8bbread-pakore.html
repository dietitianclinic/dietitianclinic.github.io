You will need :- Batter and layer<br />
3 cup besan or chickpea flour&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 tbsp rice flour ( optional )</p>
<p>salt to taste</p>
<p>1 tsp. red chilli powder</p>
<p>1/4 tsp. turmeric powder</p>
<p>1/2 tsp. crushed ajwain seeds ( carom seeds )</p>
<p>water</p>
<p>You will need ;- Other stuff</p>
<p>12-16 bread slices</p>
<p>2 tsp. butter or margarine</p>
<p>Oil for deep fry&nbsp;<br />
Method :- Mint and Coriander Chutney - Green Chutney</p>
<p>Place all the ingredients into a blender and blend with minimum water. It should be thick chutney.<br />
Method :- Onion and Tomato Chutney - Red Chutney</p>
<p>Heat oil and saute onion and garlic for few minutes or until light brown.</p>
<p>Add chopped tomatoes, sugar and salt, let it cook till all the moisture evaporates.</p>
<p>Add thick tomato puree and red chilli powder, let it cook for another minute or so.</p>
<p>Switch off the heat, let it cool slightly.</p>
<p>Grind in the grinder until smooth paste.<br />
Method :- Potato stuffing</p>
<p>Heat oil in a kadai, add cumin seeds when they crackle add hing.</p>
<p>Now add crushed chilli and ginger and fry for few seconds.</p>
<p>Switch off the heat, add remaining ingredients and mix well.</p>
<p>Leave it aside.<br />
Method :- Batter</p>
<p>Take square cake tin or any dish.</p>
<p>Place all the ingredients and mix well.</p>
<p>Add water little by little and make not too thick not too thin batter.</p>
<p>I keep batter little thinner side, as I don't like too much thick besan flour layer on my any kind of pakora, however it becomes little extra hard work for me.</p>
<p>Whisk the batter with the egg whisker, making sure no lumps are in the batter.</p>
<p>Leave it aside.<br />
Method :- Making Pakora</p>
<p>Place oil in a kadai and put it on a medium heat.</p>
<p>Meanwhile take 4 slices of bread for one pakora.</p>
<p>Spread very thinly butter on one side on each slice.</p>
<p>Now spread green chutney on the butter side.</p>
<p>Lay another bread slices on top of the green chutney slice. ( Butter side up )</p>
<p>Take 2 tbsp. potato stuffing and apply evenly.</p>
<p>Take 3rd bread slice and lay on top of the potato stuffing. ( Butter side up )</p>
<p>Spread red chutney.</p>
<p>Lay 4th bread slice, butter side on the red chutney side.</p>
<p>Make sure all the sides are in line.</p>
<p>Gently press all over.</p>
<p>Very gently put whole sandwich into the batter.</p>
<p>With the spoon pour batter on the bread sandwich.</p>
<p>Make sure sandwich is coated with the batter from everywhere.</p>
<p>Now is the hard part, keep patience .</p>
<p>Lower the heat of the oil.</p>
<p>Take one flat spatula and slide very slowly under the bread sandwich.</p>
<p>Life it very carefully, hold it for few seconds, let excess batter drop in the tray, &nbsp;with the help of another spatula gently slip away the whole sandwich into the hot oil. ( Be very careful,)</p>
<p>Don't turn away the pakora very quickly, keep poring hot oil over the pakora from the sides with the stainless still slotted spoon</p>
<p>Once you see the upper layer of the pakora covered in oil, very gently turn away the pakora.</p>
<p>Fry till you see crispy and brown pakora.</p>
<p>Remove from the oil.</p>
<p>Leave it for few seconds on a clean kitchen paper.</p>
<p>Very gently cut the pakora into four triangle with bread knife.</p>
<p>Serve HOT bread pakoda with tea or any cold beverage.</p>
