1/2 tsp. crushed ajwain seeds ( carom seeds )

water

You will need ;- Other stuff

12-16 bread slices

2 tsp. butter or margarine

Oil for deep fry&nbsp;  
Method :- Mint and Coriander Chutney - Green Chutney

Place all the ingredients into a blender and blend with minimum water. It should be thick chutney.  
Method :- Onion and Tomato Chutney - Red Chutney

Heat oil and saute onion and garlic for few minutes or until light brown.

Add chopped tomatoes, sugar and salt, let it cook till all the moisture evaporates.

Add thick tomato puree and red chilli powder, let it cook for another minute or so.

Switch off the heat, let it cool slightly.

Grind in the grinder until smooth paste.  
Method :- Potato stuffing

Heat oil in a kadai, add cumin seeds when they crackle add hing.

Now add crushed chilli and ginger and fry for few seconds.

Switch off the heat, add remaining ingredients and mix well.

Leave it aside.  
Method :- Batter

Take square cake tin or any dish.

Place all the ingredients and mix well.

Add water little by little and make not too thick not too thin batter.

I keep batter little thinner side, as I don't like too much thick besan flour layer on my any kind of pakora, however it becomes little extra hard work for me.

Whisk the batter with the egg whisker, making sure no lumps are in the batter.

Leave it aside.  
Method :- Making Pakora

Place oil in a kadai and put it on a medium heat.

Meanwhile take 4 slices of bread for one pakora.

Spread very thinly butter on one side on each slice.

Now spread green chutney on the butter side.

Lay another bread slices on top of the green chutney slice. ( Butter side up )

Take 2 tbsp. potato stuffing and apply evenly.

Take 3rd bread slice and lay on top of the potato stuffing. ( Butter side up )

Spread red chutney.

Lay 4th bread slice, butter side on the red chutney side.

Make sure all the sides are in line.

Gently press all over.

Very gently put whole sandwich into the batter.

With the spoon pour batter on the bread sandwich.

Make sure sandwich is coated with the batter from everywhere.

Now is the hard part, keep patience .

Lower the heat of the oil.

Take one flat spatula and slide very slowly under the bread sandwich.

Life it very carefully, hold it for few seconds, let excess batter drop in the tray, &nbsp;with the help of another spatula gently slip away the whole sandwich into the hot oil. ( Be very careful,)

Don't turn away the pakora very quickly, keep poring hot oil over the pakora from the sides with the stainless still slotted spoon

Once you see the upper layer of the pakora covered in oil, very gently turn away the pakora.

Fry till you see crispy and brown pakora.

Remove from the oil.

Leave it for few seconds on a clean kitchen paper.

Very gently cut the pakora into four triangle with bread knife.

Serve HOT bread pakoda with tea or any cold beverage.
