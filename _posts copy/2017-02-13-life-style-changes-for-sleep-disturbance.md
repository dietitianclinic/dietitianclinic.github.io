Lifestyle changes for sleep disorders  
Take hot water bath half an hour after dinner.You can add few drops of lavender oil in water for better results.  
Take warm milk or warm almond milk before going to bed.  
Avoid tea and coffee after 10:00 am  
Avoid tobacco products and alcohol.  
Dont keep TV and electronic gadgets in the bedroom.  
Turn off these gadgets atleast 2 hours before going to bed (No online presence after 8:30 pm). The type of light these screens emit can stimulate your brain, suppress the production of melatonin, and interfere with your bodyâ€™s internal clock.  
Off all lights when going to sleep. Keep heavy curtains on windows if light is coming from outside.  
Keep bedroom comfortably cool.  
If you are unable to fall asleep do some reading from book in another room and when you feel sleepy go to bedroom and sleep.  
Avoid or limit naps. Naps can make it harder to fall asleep at night. If you can't get by without one, try to limit a nap to no more than 30 minutes and don't nap after 3 p.m.  
Exercise regularly : Brisk Walking, running, jogging, skipping, swimming, cycling, climbing stairs etc at least 30-45 mins daily (increase gradually). After 30 mins of small meals or after 1 hr of main meal. Do not exercise on empty stomach. Do not exercise immediately after meals.  
Maintain regular sleep schedule in all days of the week.  
Maintain healthy lifestyle and good eating habits.  
Include fresh fruits and vegetables in your daily diet .  
Once these changes are achieved start reducing dosage of your sleeping pills (if any) and finally stop it after few weeks.
