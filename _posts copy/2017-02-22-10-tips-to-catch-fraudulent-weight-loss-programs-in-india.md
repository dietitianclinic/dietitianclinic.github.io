The weight loss and weight gain industry is not regulated in India. It is up to you to choose a safe and trustworthy weight management program.

Here are some "red flags" that may tell you that a program does not meet your health needs:

- Promises fast weight-loss (more than one kilogram (two pounds) per week).  
- Recommends a very low calorie diet plan (below 800 calories) per day) without medical supervision.  
- Tries to make you dependent on their company by selling you products such as foods or supplements rather than teaching you how to make good choices from regular grocery store food.  
- Does not encourage long term realistic lifestyle changes, including regular exercise and a healthy diet that suits your lifestyle and health.  
- Employs salespeople who act as" counselors, but are only trained on the program and the company?s products and not on healthy approaches to help you change your behaviour to help you lose weight.  
- Requires you to sign a long term, expensive contract.  
- Pressures you to sign up right away by offering a" special price.  
- Does not tell you about risks that may go along with weight loss or their specific program (for example: if you have diabetes and take prescription medication, it may affect you differently after you lose weight).  
- Promotes weight loss aids like starch blockers, fat-burners, herbs, supplements or amino acids that have not been scientifically proven to have any health benefits. Talk to a dietitian or other health professional to find out this information.  
- Does not offer support or follow-up to help you lose weight and keep it off.

In general, if it sounds too good or too easy to be true, it probably is.
