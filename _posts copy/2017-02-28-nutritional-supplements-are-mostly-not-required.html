<p>When taking supplements consider the following:<br />
There may be side effects;</p>
<p>There may be adverse reactions from interaction with other herbs or drugs;</p>
<p>Controlling dosage and purity can be a problem with herbs;</p>
<p>They may be unnecessary and, while not harmful, of no benefit;</p>
<p>Natural doesn't imply beneficial or harmless;</p>
<p>Although some supplements contain useful drugs, they may not be suitable for self-medication because optimal control of some medical conditions should be tailored to individual risk factors and be medically monitored;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is always the possibility that there is a safer, more reliable, and cheaper alternative available.</p>
