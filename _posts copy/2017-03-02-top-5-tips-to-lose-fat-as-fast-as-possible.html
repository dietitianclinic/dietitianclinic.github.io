<p>
1. Drink more water. One study shows that drinking water half an hour before meals helps you eat fewer calories and lose 44% more weight. It can also boost metabolism slightly.</p>
<p>2. Eat a high-protein breakfast. Studies show that people who replace a grain-based breakfast with high-protein foods like eggs, chicken etc without added oil\fat feel full for the next 36 hours and lose up to 65% more weight.</p>
<p>3. Eat viscous fiber. Viscous fiber supplements like glucomannan can help you lose weight, especially around the belly area.</p>
<p>4. Use smaller plates. Studies show that people automatically eat less when they use smaller plates. Strange, but it works.</p>
<p>5. Sleep better. Poor sleep is one of the strongest risk factors for weight gain and obesity, taking care of your sleep is important.</p>
