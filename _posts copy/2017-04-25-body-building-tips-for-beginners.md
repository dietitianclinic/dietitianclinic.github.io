My number one tip for beginners is to develop a plan. Everyone wants to get in shape, but because so many people don't have a plan, there is a high failure rate. Four key elements belong in every new fitness plan:

1. **Nutrition:** Eat 4-6 meals per day to avoid cravings, keep blood sugar levels stable, and keep hunger at bay. If you want to gain weight, it takes more calories. If you want to lose weight, you need to consume fewer. This may be old-school advice, but it works!
2. **Cardio:** Cardio is important for keeping body-fat levels in check, increasing endurance, and decreasing your risk of cardiovascular disease. Even in the offseason, I do 20 minutes of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) daily.
3. **Strength Training:** Even if your goal is fat loss, building muscle can help speed up your metabolism and burn many more calories, even when you're at rest. If muscle gain is the goal, then spending time with the iron is a no-brainer.
4. **Supplementation:** It's nearly impossible to get all of your necessary nutrients from food alone. Supplements can help fill gaps in your nutrition and may help you perform better in the gym.
