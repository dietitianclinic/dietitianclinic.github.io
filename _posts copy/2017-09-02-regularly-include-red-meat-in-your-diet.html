<p>Here are my six reasons to include red meat in your diet:</p>
<p>1. It’s healthy.</p>
<p>There are 29 lean cuts of beef. According to India's National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) standards, Beef provides nutrients like zinc, iron, protein and B vitamins, and half of the fat found in beef is monounsaturated, the same heart-healthy fats found in olive oil.</p>
<p>2. Its a versatile kitchen ingredient.</p>
<p>Beef is an easy addition to a well-balanced meal. Simply fire up the grill or turn on the slow cooker, and you’ve got a healthy, simple meal that stars meat.</p>
<p>3. It’s environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>Cattle graze on land that is too steep, hilly or rocky for farming. Cattle aerate the soil and eat brush, which is good for wildfire management. Beef production is good for the planet. Beef production indirectly increases the number of living cattle and thus helps the natural food chain. Methane generated from cattle is less compared to pollution from vehicles.</p>
<p>4. It’s affordable.</p>
<p>Calorie-for-calorie, beef is more nutrient dense than vegetarian protein options like peanut butter, tofu or beans. You get more nutritional bang for your buck by choosing healthy, lean animal proteins.</p>
<p>5. It’s kind.</p>
<p>Cattlemen care about their livestock; it makes good business sense and it’s the right thing to do. Respectfully harvesting these animals to nourish people is a part of the circle of life, and something that ranchers take very seriously.</p>
<p>6. It will make you good-looking, muscular and intelligent.</p>
<p>Without protein as the center of my diet, I feel depleted of energy. Sure, vegetables and fruits are great, but without protein power, I’m not strong. And, being strong makes you look and feel good! There are many essential brain nutrients which are only found in meat. Europeans, Americans and Arabs regularly consume beef which contributes to their body buildup and intelligence. No wonder not a single noble prize winner has been a vegetarian.</p>
