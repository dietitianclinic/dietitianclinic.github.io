When taking supplements consider the following:

1. There may be side effects;
2. There may be adverse reactions from interaction with other herbs or drugs;
3. Controlling dosage and [purity](http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/dietarysupplements/dietary-supplements-intro) can be a problem with herbs;
4. They may be unnecessary and, while not harmful, of no benefit;
5. [_Natural_](http://skepdic.com/natural.html) doesn't imply _beneficial_ or _harmless_;
6. Although some supplements contain useful drugs, they may not be suitable for self-medication because optimal control of some medical conditions should be tailored to individual risk factors and be medically monitored; and
7. There is always the possibility that there is a safer, more reliable, and cheaper alternative available.
