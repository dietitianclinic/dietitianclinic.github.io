A common misconception among the people is that egg yolk is bad for your health and many people throw it right away. Lets check out what is the fact.  
Vitamins  
Egg yolk contains more vitamins than egg whites. Each egg yolk contains seven vitamins: B6, folate, B-12, A, D, E and K. Of those, vitamins A, D, E and K are found only in egg yolks and not in egg whites.  
Minerals  
Egg yolks and egg whites both have 13 minerals. These minerals include calcium, magnesium, iron, potassium, sodium and selenium. But the yolk has more of them than egg white.  
Antioxidants:  
Egg yolk is a very good source of antioxidants because of the carotenoids found in them specially lutein and zeaxanthin . These antioxidants protect our body from free radical damage.They show promising effect against age-related macular degeneration and cataracts. They also protect us from heart disease and breast cancer.  
Heart friendly:

Egg yolks are heart friendly when taken in moderation because of the presence of choline in them. They are also a good source of Omega-3 fatty acids (good fats)

Cholesterol and saturated fats:

1 large egg yolk provides 61% of a days cholesterol limit but our liver also produces cholesterol. If cholesterol content in diet is more, liver will produce less cholesterol and if cholesterol is less in our diet liver will produce more of it. Cholesterol is a very important nutrient and is essential in normal functioning of our body.

I large egg yolk also provides 1.6 gms of saturated fat which is just 8% of a days limit.

High quality protien  
Last but not least, they are a good source of high quality protein which helps in building muscles and also helps in weight loss by keeping you full for long time.  
To conclude, egg yolks and for that matter, whole eggs are a super food which you should incorporate in your diet. A whole egg is better than a multivitamin capsule, most of which consists of fillers and binders and preservatives etc.  
Depending on your overall health and activity level you can safely take 1-2 whole eggs daily.  
If you have high blood cholesterol or heart disease or family history of early heart disease, you should consult your doctor/registered dietitian regarding the amount of egg yolk you can take per day or weather you need to avoid it completely.
